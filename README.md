# The Problem:
Playing the wrong music at a party can completely ruin the experience for the guests and managing the music can be tedious for the hosts. Hiring a DJ could solve this problem, but cost is often prohibitive. Our goal is to make music selection accessible to our guests and carefree for our hosts. Our website automatically suggests songs based on the music tastes of the guests and allows guests to vote on what they want to hear.

## Audience
Our target audience consists of anybody who attends or hosts events ranging from a group of friends to large private events. Fed up of people taking over your computer and music systems at the parties to play their favourite songs? Our website provides the solution where guests can vote for their favorite song and decide which one should be next in the queue so that you can entertain your crowd better without worrying much. 

## Similar Applications
There are a few similar applications such as Festify, Jukestar, and Populrr that also have our voting feature. Festify allows people to vote for songs to push them up the queue, while Jukestar makes it so that you can veto songs off the list if enough people vote. 

## Their Limitations
Festify offers guest voting but none of the applications will automatically keep the party 
going by queuing songs based on guests’ taste. There are several music applications such as Festify, Jukebox, Trackt, etc that have the voting feature to play specific songs, but what if they don’t have a continually suggested playlist that is based off of the voted for songs. Our web app will start and end with user preferences that are present at the moment  which no other applications have so far. Another application with seemingly similar features called Spartify has a theoretically good idea, but the execution was obviously poor. There was little to no effort put into user experience or actual implementation.
